The technology that directly communicates with machines by measuring the brain activity is called the brain–machine interface (BMI) (Andersen et al., 2004, Lebedev and Nicolelis, 2006; Patil et al., 2008). Recently, BMI has been actively studied for restoring freedom in individuals with physical disabilities and enriching the lives of healthy individuals (Bai et al., 2010, Bos et al., 2010, Chaudhary et al., 2016; Murguialday et al., 2013). The process of analyzing brain activity data and converting it into commands for the purpose of operating external devices, such as a robotic arm or mouse cursor, is called decoding (Naseer and Hong, 2015, Sussillo et al., 2012). Although external device manipulation can partially be performed using the existing BMI technology, the accuracy and speed of movements are not comparable to the normal body; it is, therefore, necessary to improve the decoding technology. Decoding methods used for BMI are based on the concepts of rate and population coding (Fetzh, 1969; Fetzh and Finocchio, 1975; Georgopoulos et al., 1986; Hou et al., 2019; Pouget et al., 2000; Shidara et al., 1993). These decoding methods consider that motion information is proportional to the firing rate of a single neuron in the primary motor cortex or the linear sum of the firing rates of multiple neurons (Carmena et al., 2003, Hochberg et al., 2006, Serruya et al., 2002, Wu et al., 2006). The firing rate is usually calculated by setting an appropriate bin width and counting the number of spikes contained within the bin (Jamie and Michael, 2002, Shimazaki and Shinomoto, 2007, Sugrue et al., 2004). The shorter the bin width, the higher the time resolution of external device controls and smoother the control (Cunningham et al., 2010; Wessberg and Nicolelis, 2004). Shorter bin widths are desirable because the information in the time domain shorter than the bin width cannot be represented (Reinagel and Reid, 2000; Theunissen et al., 1995; Thorpe, 1990). For example, humans can respond to visual stimuli with a time lag of approximately 200 ms (Thorpe et al., 1996); thus, a bin width of less than 200 ms (ideally, 10–50 ms) is needed to represent this movement. However, shorter bin widths make high-precision decoding difficult, and bins of tens to hundreds of milliseconds are being currently used in practice (Shimazaki and Shinomoto, 2007, Stavisky et al., 2018; Wessberg and Nicolelis, 2004). The difficulty associated with decoding short bin widths is due to the reduced amount of information expression by spikes in a bin (Stevens and Anthony, 1995, Thorpe, 1990).To obtain more information from a sequence of spikes in a short bin width, it is useful to compute feature values that reflect the exact time difference between the spikes, and the relationship between spike timing in multiple neurons is based on the idea of temporal coding (Butts et al., 2007, Reinagel and Reid, 2000, Singh and Levy, 2017; Theunissen et al., 1995). We developed and proposed a method of estimating the state of hidden cell assemblies from spike trains by considering the exact spike timing between neurons using a mathematical model (Asahina et al., 2022). Using this method, the ensemble activity of the higher motor cortex could be inferred from spike trains in the primary motor cortex, and information regarding ideational movement expressed in the higher motor cortex (Bear et al., 2006) could be used as the feature value for decoding. In the present study, we propose a novel method for BMI decoding using the aforementioned cell assembly state estimation method. This study aimed to improve the decoding performance by using the synaptic connectivity patterns of the cell assembly in the form of feature values in order to utilize information from the higher motor cortex for decoding.
